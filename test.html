                    <strong> Song: </strong> Proud To Be An American </p>
                    <p>If tomorrow all the things were gone,<br>
                      I&#8217;d worked for all my life.<br>
                      And I had to start again,<br>
                      with just my children and my wife.</p>
                    <p>I&#8217;d thank my lucky stars,<br>
                      to be livin here today.<br>
                    &#8216;
                      Cause the flag still stands for freedom,<br>
                      and they can&#8217;t take that away.</p>
                    <p>And I&#8217;m proud to be an American,<br>
                      where at least I know I&#8217;m free.<br>
                      And I wont forget the men who died,<br>
                      who gave that right to me.</p>
                    <p>And I gladly stand up,<br>
                      next to you and defend her still today.<br>
                    &#8216;
                      Cause there ain&#8217;t no doubt I love this land,<br>
                      God bless the USA.</p>
                    <p>From the lakes of Minnesota,<br>
                      to the hills of Tennessee.<br>
                      Across the plains of Texas,<br>
                      From sea to shining sea.</p>
                    <p>From Detroit down to Houston,<br>
                      and New York to L.A.<br>
                      Well there's pride in every American heart,<br>
                      and its time we stand and say.</p>
                    <p>That I&#8217;m proud to be an American,<br>
                      where at least I know I&#8217;m free.<br>
                      And I wont forget the men who died,<br>
                      who gave that right to me.</p>
                    <p>And I gladly stand up,<br>
                      next to you and defend her still today.<br>
                    &#8216;
                      Cause there ain&#8217;t no doubt I love this land,<br>
                      God bless the USA.</p>
                    <p>And I&#8217;m proud to be and American,<br>
                      where at least I know I&#8217;m free.<br>
                      And I wont forget the men who died,<br>
